# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Thinking Process Visualization System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (1 marker found in FR-007)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Outstanding Items

### Found Issues:

1. **FR-007 Clarification Needed**: "System MUST automatically proceed with recommended option if user doesn't respond to decision card within 60 seconds [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a way to disable auto-proceed for users who want full control?]"
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects user control and autonomy
   - **Recommendation**: Clarify during `/speckit.clarify` phase

## Notes

- Specification is well-structured with 5 prioritized user stories
- Clear edge cases and out-of-scope items defined
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- One clarification marker remains (FR-007) - this should be addressed before planning
