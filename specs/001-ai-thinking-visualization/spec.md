# Feature Specification: AI Thinking Process Visualization System

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-thinking-visualization`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AI思考过程可视化系统：让用户实时看到AI Agent的工作状态、决策推理和协作过程，提供透明、可感知的产品体验。包括进度可视化、决策卡片弹出、Agent拟人化交互、实时影响预测等核心功能，打造新颖有趣的用户体验。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Real-Time AI Work Progress Visibility (Priority: P1)

When a user requests the AI to build an application, they see a live progress visualization showing what each AI Agent is currently working on, what has been completed, and what's pending. This transforms the black-box AI experience into a transparent, understandable process.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of transparency. Without visibility into AI progress, users experience anxiety and uncertainty during generation. This directly addresses the core value proposition of "transparent and perceptible product experience."

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an app generation request and verifying that the progress panel displays real-time status updates for each agent's work, and delivers immediate user comprehension of the AI's current activity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has submitted an app generation request, **When** the AI begins processing, **Then** a progress panel appears showing the current phase (e.g., "Understanding requirements") with visual indicators
2. **Given** multiple agents are working in parallel, **When** user views the progress panel, **Then** each agent's current task is displayed with its status (pending, in-progress, completed)
3. **Given** an agent completes a major step, **When** the status changes, **Then** the user sees an animated transition and a brief summary of what was accomplished (e.g., "✅ Database schema created: 4 tables")
4. **Given** user returns after leaving the page mid-generation, **When** they navigate back, **Then** the progress panel reflects the current accurate state with history of completed steps

### User Story 2 - Interactive Decision Cards (Priority: P1)

During the generation process, when the AI encounters a significant decision point, it pauses and presents the user with a decision card explaining the choice, showing available options, and recommending a path based on best practices. Users can accept the recommendation or choose an alternative.

**Why this priority**: Decision cards are critical for user trust and control. They prevent the AI from making assumptions that could lead to rework, and they educate users about architectural tradeoffs. This is essential for the "novel and interesting UX" goal.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by triggering scenarios that require architectural decisions (e.g., database choice, authentication method) and verifying that decision cards appear with clear options and reasoning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AI detects a decision point requiring user input (e.g., "Should we use caching?"), **When** it reaches this point, **Then** generation pauses and a decision card appears with the question, context, and 2-4 options
2. **Given** a decision card is displayed, **When** user reviews the options, **Then** each option shows clear implications (e.g., "Option A: Redis cache - faster response, +$15/month")
3. **Given** AI has analyzed the user's requirements, **When** displaying decision card, **Then** it highlights a recommended option with brief reasoning (e.g., "Recommended: Based on your expected user load...")
4. **Given** user selects an option on a decision card, **When** they confirm, **Then** the decision is recorded, generation resumes, and the choice is reflected in subsequent work
5. **Given** user ignores a decision card for more than 60 seconds, **When** timeout occurs, **Then** system auto-selects the recommended option and notifies the user

### User Story 3 - Agent Personification and Collaboration View (Priority: P2)

Each specialized AI Agent (UI Agent, Backend Agent, Database Agent, etc.) has a distinct personality, avatar, and communication style. Users can see agents "discussing" decisions and collaborating, making the technical process more engaging and understandable.

**Why this priority**: Personification transforms a mechanical process into an engaging experience. It helps users understand the different aspects of app building (UI, backend, database) and makes the system more memorable and trustworthy. This supports the "novel and interesting user experience" goal.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by observing the progress panel during a multi-agent generation scenario and verifying that agent avatars are displayed, agents have distinct communication styles, and inter-agent interactions are visible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple agents are working on a task, **When** user views the progress panel, **Then** each agent is represented by a unique avatar and name (e.g., "Aria" for UI Agent, "Rex" for Backend Agent)
2. **Given** an agent completes a step, **When** status updates, **Then** the agent's message reflects its personality (e.g., UI Agent: "I've optimized the button contrast to 7:1 for accessibility")
3. **Given** two agents need to coordinate (e.g., UI needs data from Backend), **When** this interaction occurs, **Then** a brief conversation is displayed showing their collaboration (e.g., "Rex: API endpoint ready at /api/users" → "Aria: Perfect, I'll connect the user list component")
4. **Given** an agent detects a potential issue with another agent's work, **When** this conflict arises, **Then** users see a friendly discussion between agents reaching a resolution

---

### User Story 4 - Real-Time Impact Prediction (Priority: P2)

When users make choices or when the AI suggests features, the system shows real-time predictions of the impact on development time, cost, performance, and complexity. This helps users make informed decisions.

**Why this priority**: Impact predictions empower users to understand tradeoffs before committing. This prevents surprise costs or complexity and builds trust through transparency. It's a key differentiator in the "transparent product experience."

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering various feature additions or configuration changes and verifying that impact metrics are displayed and updated in real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing a decision card with multiple options, **When** they hover over or select an option, **Then** impact prediction appears showing estimated effects (e.g., "+2 days development", "+$15/month cost", "Medium complexity")
2. **Given** AI suggests adding a feature (e.g., "real-time chat"), **When** suggestion is presented, **Then** impact prediction shows: development time increase, server cost estimate, expected user benefit percentage
3. **Given** user adds a feature to their requirements mid-generation, **When** the feature is added, **Then** the overall timeline and cost estimates update in real-time to reflect the change
4. **Given** AI identifies a simpler alternative to user's request, **When** presenting the alternative, **Then** side-by-side impact comparison is shown (e.g., "Your choice: 5 days, $30/mo" vs "Alternative: 3 days, $10/mo, 90% of benefits")

---

### User Story 5 - Progress History and Reasoning Export (Priority: P3)

After generation completes, users can review the full history of decisions made, agent activities, and reasoning chains. They can export this as a report to understand how their application was built.

**Why this priority**: This provides long-term transparency and educational value. Users can learn from the AI's decisions and reference the reasoning later when maintaining or modifying their app. This is valuable but not critical for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested after completing an app generation by verifying that a complete history log is accessible and exportable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app generation is complete, **When** user clicks "View Generation History", **Then** a timeline view shows all steps, decisions, and agent activities in chronological order
2. **Given** user is viewing the history, **When** they click on a decision point, **Then** the full reasoning chain is expanded showing why that choice was made
3. **Given** user wants to reference the process later, **When** they click "Export Report", **Then** a formatted document is generated containing the full decision log with reasoning
4. **Given** user is viewing a specific agent's contributions, **When** they filter by agent, **Then** only that agent's work and decisions are displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an AI Agent encounters an error or gets stuck? (System should show agent's "thinking" process, display error message in personality-appropriate style, and offer alternatives)
- How does the system handle very fast operations that complete before users can read them? (Minimum display time of 800ms for each step, with option to replay/review)
- What if user's network connection drops during generation? (Progress state is preserved server-side, automatically resumes and syncs when connection restores)
- How many decision cards can appear in one generation session? (Maximum of 5 critical decisions requiring user input; others use smart defaults and can be reviewed later)
- What happens when users navigate away mid-generation? (Generation continues in background, notification when complete, full progress preserved for review on return)
- How are concurrent users' generation processes isolated? (Each session has unique ID, progress state stored per-user, no cross-contamination)

## Assumptions

- Users have stable internet connection capable of maintaining WebSocket connections (fallback: polling every 2 seconds if WebSocket fails)
- Users are accessing the platform via modern web browsers that support WebSocket, CSS animations, and JavaScript ES6+ features
- Average app generation takes 5-15 minutes, providing sufficient time for users to engage with the visualization
- Users prefer transparency over speed (willing to see agent "thinking" even if it adds marginal display time)
- Agent personalities and communication styles should be professional yet friendly, avoiding overly casual or childish tones
- Decision points requiring user input are limited to architecturally significant choices (< 5 per session on average)
- Cost estimates assume standard cloud hosting prices (AWS/Azure/GCP) and are presented as monthly operational costs
- Development time estimates assume standard complexity and experienced AI agent performance
- Export report format preference: Markdown is default (easily readable in GitHub/editors), PDF available as alternative

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this feature:

- Interactive editing of agent-generated code during the visualization process (that would be a separate code editor feature)
- Real-time collaboration between multiple human users watching the same generation
- Voice narration or audio feedback from agents (purely text-based interactions for MVP)
- 3D or VR/AR visualization of the agent collaboration (2D web UI only)
- Detailed technical logs or debugging information for developers (focused on high-level transparency for all users)
- Ability for users to "pause" generation mid-stream and modify requirements (requirements must be set upfront)
- Gamification elements like points, badges, or competitive leaderboards (focus is on transparency, not gaming)
- Historical comparison of multiple generation sessions for the same user (each session is independent)
- Customization of agent personalities or avatars by users (predefined personalities only)
